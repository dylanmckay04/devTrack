# DevTrack

DevTrack is a full-stack job application tracker designed to feel fast, reliable, and production-oriented. It combines a drag-and-drop Kanban workflow with secure realtime updates, document storage, and scheduled reminders so users can manage their search in one place.

This project is the centerpiece of my portfolio and reflects how I approach software engineering end-to-end: product thinking, backend reliability, security hardening, and practical UX.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Full-stack ownership across React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, and cloud storage
- Realtime architecture with server-authoritative events and user-scoped WebSocket delivery
- Security-focused implementation details, including short-lived single-use socket tokens with replay protection
- Testing discipline with integration tests for authentication, authorization, CRUD, and realtime edge cases
- Practical product design for a real user workflow rather than isolated feature demos

## Features

- Kanban board with four status columns: Applied -> Interviewing -> Offer -> Rejected
- Drag-and-drop Kanban cards with optimistic UI updates and automatic rollback on failed writes
- Full application CRUD with notes, job URL, and date tracking
- Document uploads (resume, cover letter) stored in Cloudflare R2
- Scheduled email reminders powered by Celery + Redis
- Real-time board updates via WebSockets with automatic reconnect and token refresh
- Analytics dashboard with application stats and weekly activity charts
- JWT authentication with bcrypt-sha256 password hashing and short-lived signed WebSocket tokens

## Key Engineering Highlights

- Server-originated board events (no client event echo) to keep the backend as the source of truth
- User-scoped websocket routing so clients only receive their own events
- Short-lived socket tokens minted from an authenticated HTTP endpoint
- Single-use jti replay protection backed by Redis, with a process-local fallback for temporary Redis outages
- Exponential-backoff websocket reconnect with token re-auth on reconnect

## Tech Stack

### Languages

- Python
- JavaScript

### Frameworks

- FastAPI
- React

### Platform and Technical Components

- Alembic migrations
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- PostgreSQL
- Pydantic validation
- Uvicorn app server
- Cloudflare R2 for document storage
- Celery + Redis for scheduled reminders
- User-scoped, server-originated WebSocket board events
- Pytest suite covering auth, CRUD, and WebSocket security/replay hardening

## Testing

The backend includes a pytest suite for authentication, authorization, application CRUD, and realtime/security behavior. Tests run against a dedicated PostgreSQL test database and use FastAPI TestClient with dependency overrides to isolate from production data.

### Test Coverage

- User registration and JWT authentication flow
- Protected route enforcement without a valid token
- Full application CRUD: create, read, update status, delete
- Authorization isolation (users cannot access each other’s applications)
- WebSocket event broadcast on application create/status updates
- Cross-user WebSocket event isolation
- Single-use short-lived socket token replay protection
- Redis-unavailable fallback behavior for socket token replay checks

Test strategy: focus on integration behavior at API and websocket boundaries where regressions are most likely to impact real users.

### Running Tests

1. Ensure a PostgreSQL database named devtrack_test exists locally.
2. From the backend directory, run:

```bash
pytest -v
```

## Technical Decisions

### Why Celery + Redis for reminders?

Reminders are one-off scheduled tasks at arbitrary times, which is a poor fit for cron-style scheduling. Running scheduling logic inside the FastAPI process risks losing pending tasks on process restarts. Celery workers with Redis persist scheduled tasks outside the web process and support scheduling with `apply_async(..., eta=...)`.

### Why WebSockets for board sync?

The board is a shared, stateful view. If one tab changes status, other tabs should update instantly without refresh. WebSockets provide low-latency server push and avoid polling overhead. DevTrack uses server-originated board events (not client echo) and user-scoped delivery so each user only receives their own events.

### Why enum-based application status?

The `ApplicationStatus` enum constrains status to `applied`, `interviewing`, `offer`, or `rejected`, preserving data integrity and ensuring each card maps to a valid board column.

### Why Cloudflare R2 over S3?

R2 is S3-compatible (same boto3 patterns) and avoids egress fees, which is cost-effective for frequent document download workflows.

### Why FastAPI over Flask?

FastAPI provides strong performance, automatic OpenAPI docs, and native async support that fits WebSockets and background-task workflows.

### Why PostgreSQL over SQLite?

PostgreSQL is a production-grade relational database with strong concurrency and integrity features. It also supports enum types used for application status.

## Security and Realtime Hardening

- Server-authoritative board events: application create/update/delete/status changes emit from backend after commit
- User-scoped delivery: each socket is bound to an authenticated user and receives only that user’s events
- Short-lived socket tokens: frontend requests a dedicated token from `POST /auth/socket-token`
- Replay protection with `jti`: each socket token has a unique token ID that is consumed once at connect
- Redis-backed token tracking with fallback: Redis is primary, with process-local in-memory fallback for temporary Redis outages
- Client reconnect + re-auth: frontend reconnects with exponential backoff and mints a fresh socket token each attempt

Tradeoff note: in-memory connection management and fallback token tracking keep local development simple, but horizontal scale requires Redis pub/sub and shared token-state guarantees across instances.

## Known Limitations

- WebSocket connection state is in-memory, so sync is single-instance only
- If Redis is unavailable, socket token replay tracking falls back to process-local memory (not shared across instances)
- Documents cannot yet be previewed in-app (upload/delete only)
- Reminders cannot be edited after creation
- No board pagination for very large datasets

## Future Improvements

- Presigned URL document preview in the browser
- Redis pub/sub for multi-instance WebSocket fanout
- OAuth login (GitHub, Google)
- Email notifications on application status changes
